#LinkedIn Bot#

This LinkedIn bot is a Python-made bot created to be used to get a list of people that work for a given enterprise which you want to get information about.

Using this bot:

To install this bot, you will need Python 3, Selenium and another python file called secrets, in which you need to have your LinkedIn email and password, like this:

{
email = "email@email.com"
password = "something"
}

After you have all the requisites needed, you just have to run the bot in a command line with python passing the name of the enterprise and the output filename.
